# Covid Project


# Technologies Used
Language: Python

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Working with Python and Jupyter Notebook, Pandas will be used to clean and organize the data for this project, and to perform our exploratory analyses.

## Database Storage
SQLite is the database we intend to use for this project.

## Machine Learning
We intend to use Jupyter Notebook to create two separate but similar supervised machine learning models for each analysis:

**Anaysis 1 - Global Diet & Obesity/ Obesity & Covid Mortality**

Supervised, testing and training the dataset to use the global diet features as predictors for obesity and then obesity as a predictor for covid mortality.

**Analysis 2 - Population & Obesity/ Population & Covid-19 Mortality**

Supervised, with additional predictors (age, population) as predicators of obesity and covid 19 mortality.

## Dashboard
To visualize the results of this project we are going to use HTML and D3.js (nested charts), OR Tableau to create the final dashboard.
